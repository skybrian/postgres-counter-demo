A simple demonstration of how to build an old-fashioned database-backed website
using the free tiers of some fairly new Internet services. (New as of 2023.)

Here are the technologies I used:

- Deno Deploy: web hosting
- Deno Fresh: web framework (server-side only for this demo)
- Neon: Postgres database hosting
